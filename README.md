# Secret Santa Gift Exchange API üéÅ
This project provides a RESTful API to help a group of friends or family organize a Secret Santa gift exchange event. The API manages participants, assigns gifts randomly, and ensures that each participant can view only their assigned recipient without revealing others.

## üßß Project Structure
The project is organized into layers based on Clean Architecture principles:

- `application/`: Contains DTOs (data transfer objects) and use cases (business logic).
- `domain/`: Contains the core business models and domain services.
- `infrastructure/`: Contains infrastructure-related configurations, such as security, repositories, and Swagger documentation.
- `exception/`: Defines custom exceptions to handle various error scenarios.
- `mapper/`: Contains classes to map between domain models and database entities.
- `persistence/`: Defines entities for the database and repositories for interacting with the data.
- `interfaces/`: Contains the controllers that handle HTTP requests.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests to ensure proper functionality of services and use cases.

## ‚ú® Endpoints
The following are the key API endpoints provided:

1. Register Participant
- URL: `/participants`
- Method: POST
- Request body:
```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```
- Response: Returns the created participant with their details.

2. Generate Gift Assignments
- URL: `/assignments/generate`
- Method: POST
- Request body: None
- Response: Returns a success message, and gift assignments are stored in the system.

3. Get Assigned Recipient
- URL: `/participants/{email}`
- Method: GET
- Request params:
- email: The email of the participant.
- Response: Returns the recipient's name and email assigned to the participant.

4. List All Participants (Admin Only)
- URL: `/participants`
- Method: GET
- Response: Returns a list of all registered participants.

### üåü Validations
- No Duplicate Participants: The API ensures no two participants can register with the same email.
- No Self-Assignments: A participant cannot be assigned to themselves.
- Email Format: Validates that emails are in a proper format (using the @Email annotation).

## üíü Authentication
- Basic Authentication or JWT token-based authentication is required for endpoints that retrieve sensitive data (e.g., the recipient's information).
- Admin Access: The /participants endpoint for listing all participants is accessible only by an admin. Admin credentials should be configured and authenticated.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Bonus Feature: Email Notifications
As a bonus feature, participants will receive an email notification with the details of their assigned recipient. The email includes:
- The name of the recipient.
- A suggestion for a gift.
- A friendly message reminding the participant of the event.
- The email is sent via SMTP using Spring Email Services.

## üéÑ Testing
Unit tests are included for all key services and use cases, ensuring proper behavior of the application:
`GiftExchangeServiceTest.java`: Tests the functionality of generating assignments and sending emails.
`ParticipantServiceTest.java`: Tests the creation and lookup of participants.
The tests are located under the test/domain/service/ directory and can be run using Maven or your IDE's testing framework.
